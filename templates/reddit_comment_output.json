Humans simply can not be culturless. People like to joke about Americans having no culture but they do. We had culture, and it was banned. We didn’t want to adopt our enemy’s culture so naturally, our own culture shifted and adapted until rebel songs essentially became an important part of our culture. So what, now we ban our culture again?", "If anything rebel songs are the most authentic form of Irish culture because every other aspect of our culture besides drink is a parody of what it once was as a consequence of it being under attack for so long and much of it has essentially been forgotten. It’s like we’re having an identity crisis. Almost every bit of “authentic” Irish culture we still have has had to be revived through much effort and organisation, and anything that hasn’t been revived is now long dead.", "Rebel music has emerged out of every single conflict regardless of culture and then solidified its place within that culture. The French national anthem is basically a war song, the Haka and other Polynesian dance/songs of this fashion are displays of warriors. Balkan countries have their songs each basically dissing their neighbours. It’s not exclusive to Ireland, we just have recency bias as well as a cultural void that needed to be filled."]},
